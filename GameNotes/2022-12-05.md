To use the asset manager it must be used on a case by case basis I think. We load in assets as we need them?.... I assumed it was a kind of library we could call anytime we need tbh. 

Okay so after loading them we can retrieve them with their filename and the relevant class passed as a param into a .get() method 
````
Texture tex = manager.get("data/mytexture.png", Texture.class);
BitmapFont font = manager.get("data/myfont.fnt", BitmapFont.class);
````
Additionally we can load and unload textures from the manager to clean up space. 
Again, this all is very low-level bs I don't want to think about. I think I need to find a way to seal this up tbh... I wish I was faster at picking this stuff up tbh. My brain doesn't interface with this unless I'm explaining it *wha wha* baby gonna cri
Anyways, going to add a loading method into the main game screen later and just add it to the main menu screen for now. 

So now we can rewrite the code so at the start we 
- [ ] Find each new Texture instance 
- [ ] Replace with relevant manager.get() call 


We need to replace the GameScreen in the ship with a gameObjectManager so we can encapsulate the way we manage the gameObjects overall. This will make it simpler
