This is a game based on ships made of square tiles. The game's main loop is arriving at a location and having stuff happen, after which you have time to adjust your ship and make it stronger. 
The "action screen" has asteroids flying everywhere in addition to other possible events, while a map screen ties the rest of the game together with nodes that can be traveled through. 
Near the beginning of the game the ship is very basic with a core and a few tiles. As time goes on the ship will be built up by the player and the player will aquire new tile types.
