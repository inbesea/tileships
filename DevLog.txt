Can we uh... Figure out where clicks handle clicking on the tiles of the

Okay, I'm starting to fall off the screen lol idk how to keep going tonight.... I have to create input event handling
the "polling" I was using is going off constantly instead of happening once? I can't use the MouseAdapter because it leaves
