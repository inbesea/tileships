<!--For each element in whatever
placeTempBlock(data)

This lets us augment map locations as well? but like... What do we do with that? We can build a ship after the top/bottom/left/right block in the ship?
Maybe find the average location for all blocks and place in the top/bott/... space closest to that so the player can build a quick bridge over there and say hey? Obviously that would be
kinda easy to break by the player placing a single block way out, but idk if that's a genuine issue? -->
